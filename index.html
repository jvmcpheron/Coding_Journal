        <h2>About Me</h2>
            
            <p>I've decided I want to teach myself to code over the summer!
            I am going to give it my best effort and this html code will log everything I have been learning!
            I will be using Codecademy to learn as much as I can, and try my best to practice along the way.</p>

                <h4>HTML</h4>
                    <p>Today I made it halfway through the Codecademy HTML course!</p>
                    <div class="list">
                    <p class="left">Some of the things I have learned:</p>

                    <p>I am still not completely familiar with everything, but it's a start that I am happy with!</p>
                <h4>UX and UI Design</h4>
                    <p>I also learned about UX and UI design! I learned what people in that field do.
                    In that course I got some familiarity with Figma, and using it to design wireframes and prototypes.</p>

            <h4>HTML</h4>
                <p>By now, I have finished the HTML course, and I have invested in Codecademy pro (it was 50% off). 
                    I plan on using the summer to self teach. I have also finished all of the quizzes for the HTML lesson,
                    and all I have left are projects for the the HTML course! I now know how to add inputs to webpages,
                    and if you want to see some work on that, <a href="page2.html">click here</a>!</p>

            <h3>04/29/2022</h3>
            <h4>Python</h4> 
                <p>I have started the Python course and I have approximately 40% of it completed.
                    I finished all of the projects in the HTML course and have the certificate of completion!
                    In Python I have learned about loops, lists, variables, and functions. 
                    It's not much, but once I become comfortable with Python basics, I can work on learning other languages!
                    I want to figure out what I enjoy most. Right now, I think I want to make a shift towards mobile development languages.
                    After Python, I have to decide where to start, with either Java, JavaScript, Kotlin or Swift!
                    I'm leaning towards Swift, because it is simple, but JavaScript is tempting too, because it is a very versatile language.

                <p>I finished my Python course! It's finally time to start my path towards mobile development, starting with CSS!
                    After CSS I wanna learn JavaScript, React, and React Native. Then, if I have time, I can learn Java, Kotlin, and Swift.

                <h4>CSS</h4>
                <p>I've started learning CSS! I've learned some basic styling and how CSS can communicate with HTML! Honestly, it feels
                    like just from knowing the basics, major doors have opened up for the level of creativity I can have in web design.
                    I know this journal looks stupid, but for now I'm just sorta using it as a playground to have fun with.
