            <p>I've decided I want to teach myself to code over the summer! </p>

            <p>I am going to give it my best effort and this html code will log everything I have been learning!</p>
            <p>I will be using Codecademy to learn as much as I can, and try my best to practice along the way.</p>

                <h4>HTML</h4>
                    <p>Today I made it halfway through the Codecademy HTML course!</p>
                    <p>Some of the things I have learned:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Lists <em>(ordered and unordered)</em></li>
                        <li>Formatting Text</li>
                        <li>Adding Media and Links</li>
                        <li>Tables</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I am still not completely familiar with everything, but it's a start that I am happy with!</p>
                <h4>UX and UI Design</h4>
                    <p>I also learned about UX and UI design! I learned what people in that field do.</p>
                    <p>In that course I got some familiarity with Figma, and using it to design wireframes and prototypes.</p>

            <h3>04/20/2022</h3>
            <h4>HTML</h4>
                <p>By now, I have finished the HTML course, and I have invested in Codecademy pro (it was 50% off). 
                    I plan on using the summer to self teach. I have also finished all of the quizzes for the HTML lesson,
                    and all I have left are projects for the the HTML course! I now know how to add inputs to webpages,
                    and if you want to see some work on that, <a href="page2.html">click here</a>!</p>

            <h3>04/29/2022</h3>
            <h4>Python</h4> 
                <p>I have started the Python course and I have approximately 40% of it completed.
                    I finished all of the projects in the HTML course and have the certificate of completion!
                    In Python I have learned about loops, lists, variables, and functions. 
                    It's not much, but once I become comfortable with Python basics, I can work on learning other languages!
                    I want to figure out what I enjoy most. Right now, I think I want to make a shift towards mobile development languages.
                    After Python, I have to decide where to start, with either Java, JavaScript, Kotlin or Swift!
                    I'm leaning towards Swift, because it is simple, but JavaScript is tempting too, because it is a very versatile language.
